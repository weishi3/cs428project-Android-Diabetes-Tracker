Diabetes tracker is an Android app which acts as a friendly alarm, record keeper and advisor for people who are suffering from diabetes. This mobile app keeps track of usersâ€™ daily stats(i.e. the food they eat, the total amount of calories they consume, and the number of steps they take). If the user has a bad lifestyle, the app will alert the user and give some proper advice. Also, this app will provide knowledge and an interface so that patients(clients) have the "ability" to manage a healthy life. Last but not least, it will keep track of the data related to health indicators (blood sugar, blood pressure and weight), and give useful suggestions.
